generate random permutations

1) assign variable N to input int

2) create an array with length of N

3) set span of random numbers: I = 0, J = (N-1)

4) create main for-loop to keep track of absolute position (like a cursor)

	a) if position is [0], generate a random number and iterate the loop
	
	b) generate a new random number X, run through secondary for-loop to compare the  generated number to X. starting from position [0] we test X, if it differs then iterate the inner loop until the end of the loop is reached. if at any time, the number is the same, the loop is aborted and a new number X is generated. the inner loop iteration starts again with the new X.

	**here is some pseudocode to explain how the 4.b method works**

while(boolean = true){

generate random number
for loop to compare{}(if generated number has duplicate loop skips to end)
(if generated number has no duplicate boolean = false exit while loop)


}
